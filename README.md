# EOChess
by Erik Olivesjoe

 ## Hobby chess project started in March 2021

 currently working on the first milestone

 ### Milestone 1
 
    Build a working pvp chess game in c++ using various information and references found online. I want to try various ways to represent the game such as bit boards and normal piece arrays to learn more about chess programming 


### Milestone 2
 
    Convert it into a pve engine that you can play against. 

### Milestone 3
 
    Continue to develop my chess engine to become a better opponent, and change all pieces into bitboards.
